		<h3>3/16/2021</h3>
		Working on a new area called 'Wars' (For now).<br>
		The idea came to me on the walk home from the metro. I saw a pigeon attacking another pigeon and it was very inspiring to me.<br>
		Pixel must have been a genius when he drew tilesets. The entire day will probably go into trying to replicate his style.<br> 
		Today I ate a carne asada torta and it had fresh onions on it and that was pretty nice. The bread was also good.<br>

		<h3>3/15/2021</h3>
		Site has launched. It is 2 AM and I am tired.<br>
		I ate a chicken sandwich today at the park. Not much work was done because I was at the park eating a chicken sandwich.<br>
		Maybe tomorrow I will do something.<br>
