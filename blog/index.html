		<h3>3/16/2021</h3>
		Still working on PrtWars. It looks like a desert level to me, but it isn't. Maybe I could show something tommorow.<br>
		Some work on map system is being done. A big fear is that players won't know it exists. Playtesters that were not familiar with the beta didn't know the flower heals.<br>
		There was an idea as a joke in the beginning of development to make the start of the game like the Ikachan intro, where it greets the players and explains the game.<br>
		Maybe we should revisit that idea, haha. I think most players that download the game will ignore Manual.html.<br>
		In the meantime, have this enemy design.<br>
		<img src="/src/img/blog/warsTower.gif"/><br>
		...and while making this GIF I have realized that the walking animation skips a frame.<br>
		I had olivier salad for lunch. I liked the potatoes and peas. I would like to eat more olivier salad.<br>

		<h3>3/15/2021</h3>
		Working on a new area called 'Wars' (For now).<br>
		The idea came to me on the walk home from the metro. I saw a pigeon attacking another pigeon and it was very inspiring to me.<br>
		Pixel must have been a genius when he drew tilesets. The entire day will probably go into trying to replicate his style.<br> 
		Today I ate a carne asada torta and it had fresh onions on it and that was pretty nice. The bread was also good.<br>

		<h3>3/14/2021</h3>
		Site has launched. It is 2 AM and I am tired.<br>
		I ate a chicken sandwich today at the park. Not much work was done because I was at the park eating a chicken sandwich.<br>
		Maybe tomorrow I will do something.<br>
