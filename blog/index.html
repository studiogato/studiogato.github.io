		<h3>4/10/2021</h3>
		Hello, it has been a while.<br>
		Some rooms are being done for the new area, don't worry about that. I haven't had anything to write about here.<br>
		I have been thinking of the different "teams" the Mimiga will be in. Obviously Shovel Brigade will be the team for mining.<br>
		These Mimiga will collect materials for weapon making in the old mines.<br>
		Another team is the Troop Brigade, they will have more access to other areas. They will be the ones in training to fight frogs.<br>
		If I haven't made it clear, the Mimiga were captured by Soap Kingdom as weapons.<br>
		Here is the design of the Troop Brigade.<br>
		<img src="/src/img/blog/NpcRegu.png"/><br>
		Maybe I should give them Firearms as well, but I don't have enough space I think.<br>
		I haven't had dinner yet (it's early) but I'm eating some Jambon-Beurres right now. They are pretty good.<br>
		<div class="ditch"></div>
		<h3>3/29/2021</h3>
		It is late again.<br>
		Map system is almost done now.<br>
		Maybe I will not do daily posts.<br>
		I ate a mixed burrito today, I think.<br>
		<div class="ditch"></div>
		<h3>3/28/2021</h3>
		Worked on a short cutscene.<br>
		The crackers I ate were nice.<br>
		<div class="ditch"></div>
		<h3>3/27/2021</h3>
		It's late again. I had to leave home today so I only had a laptop to work with.<br>
		I had to set up all my tools the entire day and didn't do anything.<br>
		Have this concept art for the 'Wars' area instead. We need to think of a better name soon.<br>
		<img src="/src/img/concept/wireWars.png"/><br>
		I ate chicken today. It was sort of raw.<br>
		<div class="ditch"></div>
		<h3>3/26/2021</h3>
		I am happy with the enemies right now. I have been working on some cutscenes today.<br>
		I had time to make a new room for the 'Wars' area.<br>
		<img src="/src/img/blog/snapWars.png"/><br>
		This area is the first original area we will be having. You can see it uses textures from the scrapped "Rockfish" game.<br>
		When designing this area and its enemies it was aimed to have to shoot the enemies. The previous area focused on avoiding enemies, as you had no weapon.<br>
		I am going to do more balancing now. Maybe add a 5 Cion variation. In the beta, the Cions (Money) enemies dropped went from 1, then 3, then 8.<br>
		Pixel also had an idea to have 20 and 50 Cion variations, but he scrapped them.<br>
		Cion is really just a mispelling of coin Pixel made, but it is fun to imagine it as a different currency.<br>
		Lunch was margherita pizza. I find I much prefer the lighter taste pizzas to traditional pepperoni pizzas these days.<br> 
		<div class="ditch"></div>
		<h3>3/25/2021</h3>
		Sorry about yesterday. Some NPC level design is being done as testing.<br>
		<img src="/src/img/blog/snapTest.png"/><br>
		I always worry about too many enemies on the screen. It can be stressful.<br>
		In CAVE STORY Beta the enemies are just put everywhere...<br>
		I ate chicken stew yesterday, now I remember. It was nice, specifically when you eat it with dipped bread.<br> 
		<div class="ditch"></div>
		<h3>3/24/2021</h3>
		It is very late. I was making ropes. I'm going to talk about it tomorrow.<br>
		I don't remember what I ate anymore. I think it was chicken.<br>
		<div class="ditch"></div>
		<h3>3/23/2021</h3>
		Sometimes code bugs can be very startling.<br>
		I made a bug today where soaps shoot bubbles and then start riding them like brooms right at you. When it first happened, I screamed because I thought the soap was alive.<br>
		I didn't know what could have caused it. It turns out I had a type of "use after free" when soaps would ride other soaps and then jump off. Not as scary once you know.<br>
		Recently I played "Kero Blaster" by Studio Pixel. I was inspired by its weapons, so I put the "Fan" weapon from it to the game.<br>
		It's a short-range weapon, but it can hit a lot of enemies. I think it will be useful against the stacked soaps.<br>
		A friend suggested I try "plazma i mleko" for breakfast. It was a crushed biscuit sprinkled over milk.<br>
		It was a different texture than most cereals, and somewhat sweet. I wonder what it might be like with condensed milk.<br>
		<div class="ditch"></div>
		<h3>3/22/2021</h3>
		I dreamt of frogs.<br>
		Curry is good.<br>
		<div class="ditch"></div>
		<h3>3/21/2021</h3>
		First prototype of frogs is being developed. I see them as smart but using older arms than soaps use.<br>
		Swords to spears are possibilities. The weakest frogs act like light cavalry.<br>
		Dinner was fried rice.<br>
		<div class="ditch"></div>
		<h3>3/20/2021</h3>
		Enemy work is still being done.<br>
		Save file backwards compatibility for testers was done. Development version is now 0.1.0.0 Alpha.<br>
		I ate moussaka today. The potatoes were good.<br>
		<div class="ditch"></div>
		<h3>3/19/2021</h3>
		Not much progress was done today, except for enemies.<br>
		I try to design the enemies before I start making the rooms, I make the rooms around the enemies.<br>
		The tools we use for editing enemies is making it hard. We usually avoid making enemies because of it.<br>
		I tried to make pizza rolls today, but almost burn my house. Thankfully in the end it was all fine. The food was delicious!<br>
		<div class="ditch"></div>
		<h3>3/18/2021</h3>
		In the Beta of CAVE STORY it is assumed that the story is about a Mimiga named Su- building a rocket and escaping.<br>
		In NABR the story will follow the same idea, but there is a reason for Su- and other Mimiga to be stuck in the caves.<br>
		There is a war happening between two kingdoms, soaps and frogs. Frog kingdom are more powerful, of course, so soap kingdom capture Mimiga that live on the surface of the island.<br>
		They use Mimiga as slaves to help during the war. In the Wars area you will see soaps and frogs fight. Mimiga will also be there.<br>
		<img src="/src/img/blog/warsPrev.png"/><br>
		Here is preview of PrtWars. It is very unfinished. This is just the basic concept of it that I need.<br>
		For dinner I had corned beef. The cabbage acid definitely complemented it. It would be too heavy on its own.
		<div class="ditch"></div>
		<h3>3/17/2021</h3>
		Today I added a new visual trick of "teleporter previews."<br>
		Previously map drawing routines only read from the single global map layer storage and only wrote to the frontbuffer.<br>
		Once I changed this I realized that I could load selected map for teleportation and draw a window to it. It makes things feel more alive.<br>
		For lunch I ate turkey on a bagel. To improve the flavor I added a small amount of saishikomi-shoyu to the cream cheese -- very successful!<br>
		<div class="ditch"></div>
		<h3>3/16/2021</h3>
		Still working on PrtWars. It looks like a desert level to me, but it isn't. Maybe I could show something tommorow.<br>
		Some work on map system is being done. A big fear is that players won't know it exists. Playtesters that were not familiar with the beta didn't know the flower heals.<br>
		There was an idea as a joke in the beginning of development to make the start of the game like the Ikachan intro, where it greets the players and explains the game.<br>
		Maybe we should revisit that idea, haha. I think most players that download the game will ignore Manual.html.<br>
		In the meantime, have this enemy design.<br>
		<img src="/src/img/blog/warsTower.gif"/><br>
		...and while making this GIF I have realized that the walking animation skips a frame.<br>
		I had olivier salad for lunch. I liked the potatoes and peas. I would like to eat more olivier salad.<br>
		<div class="ditch"></div>
		<h3>3/15/2021</h3>
		Working on a new area called 'Wars' (For now).<br>
		The idea came to me on the walk home from the metro. I saw a pigeon attacking another pigeon and it was very inspiring to me.<br>
		Pixel must have been a genius when he drew tilesets. The entire day will probably go into trying to replicate his style.<br> 
		Today I ate a carne asada torta and it had fresh onions on it and that was pretty nice. The bread was also good.<br>
		<div class="ditch"></div>
		<h3>3/14/2021</h3>
		Site has launched. It is 2 AM and I am tired.<br>
		I ate a chicken sandwich today at the park. Not much work was done because I was at the park eating a chicken sandwich.<br>
		Maybe tomorrow I will do something.<br>
