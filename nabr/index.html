		<h2>CAVE STORY Mod - Not a Beta Recreation</h2><br>
		<img src="/src/img/nabr/snapDisplay.png"/><br>
		<b>Platform</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Windows</li>
			<li>More</li>
		</ul>
		<b>Type of game</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Shooting and avoiding enemies</li>
			<li>Jumping over dangerous obstacles</li>
			<li>Exploring the areas</li>
		</ul>
		<b>Release date</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Maybe alpha soon</li>
		</ul>
		When you look at the early CAVE STORY you can see interesting ideas.<br>
		But you can see why Daisuke Amaya restarted development.<br>
		<br>
		Many gameplay ideas are flawed. Limited bullets would often get you stuck.<br>
		Some parts of the Beta of CAVE STORY looked good while others looked worse compared to the final release.<br>
		The story is not very good. Daisuke Amaya admits in the development log that it was a lot of different story ideas put together.<br>
		<br>
		<b>CAVE STORY: NABR</b> is not a CAVE STORY beta recreation. We often called it "Beta Remaster" or "Beta Fanfiction" early in development<br>
		There are other people that would like to do a recreation... But is the the beta of CAVE STORY worth playing...?<br>
		We don't have anything against preserving history, but scrapping of certain ideas often has good reasons...<br>
		<br>
		<b>CAVE STORY: NABR</b> will expand on the original ideas Daisuke Amaya had in mind, while adding original mechanics.<br>
		The structure could be compared to <a href="https://ilikebreadtoomuch.github.io/lostcave/">Escape from the Lost Cave</a> - mod one of us was working on that was scrapped.<br>
		Idea is the more you explore the more powerful you will get. The idea was not executed very good in Lost Cave, because it was very linear.<br>
		NABR takes in mind the original idea of Amaya of making CAVE STORY similar to Metroid. Exploration is a very big focus.<br>
		<br>
		We are very efficient at developing right now. Maybe there will be public alpha soon, but don't expect much. You can follow updates on the blog or in the <a href="https://discord.gg/r5qhtqddhW">Chat room</a> for discussion.<br>
